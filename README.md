## About this code challenge

This app was done by following the mobile first design, the best practices and coding styles guidelines that I know at this moment.

The app is responsive and the code is readable, easy to understand and DRY.

For point #4 in Objectives (downloading option), I’ve heard about HTML5’s canvas, but I haven’t worked with it by now. So I’ve made a button that removes all table borders. This way the user can make a perfect manual screenshot of his amazing work (for example, on mac is command + shift + 4).
