# Task Result

## Used technologies / Frameworks

I've use JavaScript ES6 in my project because, for now, this is the only technology that I know (besides HTML5 and CSS3).

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

Being a low level complexity app, I didn't need to use any 3rd party libraries.

## Installation / Run

No need to install or run anything for this project.
